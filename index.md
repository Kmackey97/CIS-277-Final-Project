## CIS 277: Final App

This app is a basic functioning version of Hangman, which allows the user to play against the computer with a list of pre-programmed words found in a text file. It has a functioning menu, complete with an About section, an option to start a New Game, and an Exit function. I hope to continue working on it over the summer break to keep in practice with C++, as well as to polish it as one of my personal projects. 

Features I hope to add include:
  - 2-player interactions with a word file for each player, allowing them to compete against one another
  - A score-keeping system for single player and PvP
  - a file system to keep track of all time scores
  - A functioning hangman ASCII pal to keep single players company
  - More refined game menus to direct the player in all areas of the program
